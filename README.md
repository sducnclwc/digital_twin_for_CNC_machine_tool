# digital twin for CNC machine tool
This ia a research project for CNC machine tool digital twin.



# Overview:

Predictive Maintenance based on Digital Twin requires a cutting edge data platform in order to handle fast streams of  IoT data, with the processing required for on-the-fly feature engineering, and the flexibility required for data science and machine learning.

1. This is the conceived implementation framework of digital twin, including machine tool perception data acquisition, storage, analysis and processing based on message queue; machine learning model construction, training, verification, deployment, service and model adaptation and application for specific application scenarios.
